    <h2>More about japanese spitz.</h2>
    <p style="color: aqua;"> 
    The Japanese Spitz was bred to be a small companion dog that is cute, loyal, friendly, and smart. Even though they aren't specifically bred to be watchdogs, they have a courageous nature and an innate desire to protect their families, as well as a bark that is quite loud for their size.</p>
